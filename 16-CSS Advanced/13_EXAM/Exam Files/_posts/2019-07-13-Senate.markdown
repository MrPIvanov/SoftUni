The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs is holding its hearing on regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies and blockchain today.

The open session, titled “Examining Regulatory Frameworks for Digital Currencies and Blockchain,” is set to start at 10:00 a.m. EST (14:00 UTC). It’s not so far been made clear if the event will be more of a fact-finding mission or if specific legislation will be discussed.

Testifying as expert witnesses will be Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, representing the Blockchain Association; Rebecca Nelson, a member of the Congressional Research Service specializing in international trade and finance; and Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor at the University of California Irvine School of Law.

The hearing will be livestreamed and you can watch it here.
