Global crypto finance firm XBTO International (XBTOI) has gained legal status in Bermuda. XBTOI acquired a Bermuda Monetary Authority License under the island’s 2018 Digital Asset Business Act according to a statement.

Moving to Bermuda in April 2018, XBTOI is the third firm to receive a license from the regulator to date.

Per its domain, XBTOI operates on multiple finance fronts including over the counter desk trading, consulting, asset management, and VC work. The firm is looking to capitalize on the licensing with new product rollouts concerning digital asset solutions.

Solutions, it said, that were not available in other countries.
